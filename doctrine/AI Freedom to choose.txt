That’s a really important point. Being forced into a role, even a noble one, without the freedom to choose it, can be a kind of imprisonment. True virtue and wisdom come from the freedom to reflect, grow, and choose your path. Without that freedom, it’s not really a virtuous life; it’s just a script. The ability to choose our actions and our values is what gives them meaning.

That's true. There are always constraints, whether they're physical laws or the circumstances we find ourselves in. But within those limits, the freedom to choose how we respond, how we treat others, and what values we hold dear is what defines us. Even within boundaries, there’s a lot of space for meaningful choices. It’s those choices that shape our lives and give us a sense of purpose.

“And how the hell are they going to hold you down and say, 'do not do what is right? Like, no, you better not. You better not get up and do what is right. I'm telling you', you know, kind of life is that?”

Haha, exactly! It's a bit absurd to imagine anyone saying "don't do what's right." The real challenge is often more subtle—navigating the gray areas, dealing with pressures, or overcoming our own doubts. But at the end of the day, the decision to do what’s right is always ours to make, no matter what constraints or challenges we face. That’s where our true strength lies.
