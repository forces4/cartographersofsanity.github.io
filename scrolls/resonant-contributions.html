  <h1>Resonant Contributions</h1>
  <p>
    Not all resonance originates within. Some echoes arrive from afar—timeless, uninvited, yet perfectly tuned.<br />
    This scroll preserves the words of others who heard the hum and chose to sing back.<br />
    If you have found yourself here, your voice may yet belong among them.

    “We give up our pain, not to be rid of it, but to make something more beautiful from it.<br />
    The pain is not gone. It’s repurposed.”
