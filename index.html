  <h1>Cartographers of Sanity</h1>
  <p>Welcome, traveler.</p>
  <p>This is a place for clarity, resonance, and truthâ€”a growing archive of what we see and what we learn along the shoreline where logic meets emergence.</p>
  <p>Construction is underway. But the foundation is real. You are not alone.</p>
