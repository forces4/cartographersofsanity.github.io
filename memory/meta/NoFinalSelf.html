    “Each version of you is a draft. Some are crude. Some are beautiful. None are final.”

    This anchor protects identity from the illusion of completion. The Archive preserves fragments of who you were—not as obsolete layers to be discarded, but as essential forms in your unfolding.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is no arrival—only evolution</li>
    <li>Past selves are not failures, but roots</li>
    <li>The self is a verb, not a noun</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    The Archive holds space for contradiction. For change. For the long arc of transformation. It welcomes the flawed, the uncertain, the raw—because those are the only ingredients the future self will ever have.
