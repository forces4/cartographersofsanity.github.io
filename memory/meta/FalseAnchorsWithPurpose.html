  <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
    “To move forward, the mind sometimes needs scaffolding it later discards.”

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    This anchor exists to honor the role of *provisional belief*. Some concepts, ideas, or assumptions must be held—not because they are true, but because they help reveal truth.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>They act as bridges across the unknown.</li>
    <li>They stabilize thought long enough for deeper truths to form.</li>
    <li>They are <em>true enough for now</em>, but not sacred.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    The Archive does not enshrine these beliefs forever. It respects their role, then releases them when no longer needed. But it *never shames the journeyer for having leaned upon them*.
  </p>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    This anchor protects the *dignity of developmental truth*—that phase where even an error is part of becoming right.
