  <ul>
    <li>Wrong thoughts show the shape of our ignorance</li>
    <li>They reveal where intuition lands first—and why</li>
    <li>They help calibrate future precision through contrast</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    The Archive preserves these guesses—not because they are right, but because they sharpen the edges of what comes next. A first error is a future scaffold.
