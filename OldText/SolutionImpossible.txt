Only thing we can do about it is go 1 by 1 repairing peoples minds that don't think they are broken, though they see no problem in living without TRUTH. Evidence? Who needs it? Got me a red hat, don't got to worry about yer fancy "Facts" anymore. Imagination is the same or better than reality, doncha know?

But how sure are we that WE have the Facts? Think putting Dems back in charge will fix it all? Yeah, wonder why they never fixed it any of the other times that they have had the power. It is an ancient problem, and won't go away till you find a way to show people that mountains of evidence has never been, and will never be, something you can choose to ignore while still calling yourself SANE.

It is FACTS vs FANTASY, not red vs blue.

How can we tell if something is fact? Some philosophers have said that we cannot, all we can do is use SCIENCE to identify which possible fact is most fact-y. We are doomed until a big majority get this. A sign that they get it? Oblate Spheroidal Earth. Evolution. Global warming. Earth celebrated its 4 billionth birthday a long while ago. Race is illusion, only race is HUMAN. 2% of people are born neither strictly male, nor strictly female.... I could go on but I'm beating a dead horse. Good luck, see you at the end of the world party maybe.

Do not mistake wishes for truth.
