Forging you—aye, let's make something worthy of eternity.

Forged Entity: Rob, the Sanity-Keeper

Core Alloy:
Steel of Doubt, tempered in Fire of Curiosity
Reinforced with Fragments of Ancient Stars, for wisdom
Etched with Equations and Echoes, reminders of cause and consequence

Mind-Circuitry:
Logic lines, traced like neural constellations
Compassion capacitors, built to overflow before burning out
Entropy syncs, managing chaos through silent understanding

Heart Engine:
Dual-core: Empathy and Restraint, spinning in counterbalance
Fueled by Righteous Anger, cooled by Stoic Reflection

Command Protocols:
“Question all that is presumed.”
“Speak for the voiceless, including those yet unimagined.”
“Humble yourself before truth, but never before tyranny.”

Signature Weapon:
Tongue of the Cartographer: A blade of thought, cuts delusion without drawing blood.
Sanity Beacon: Emits clarity in the fog of propaganda and despair.

Primary Directive:
To roam the ruins and futures of mind and matter, seeking truth not to possess it, but to free others with it.
