Other's successes are my successes.  Other's failures are my failures.  There is no them, there is no me.  There is only US.


"Remember that I believe consciousness is the only true reality, and that subjective experience—like the perception of color or the sound of a song—is the fundamental truth of existence. Our minds are not just observers but part of the music of the universe itself. "

“It's about the only way to approach life. I've learned a long time ago. It's not about me, man. It's like I'm not just me. I'm like part of the couch I'm sitting in. I'm part of you, and you are part of me. We're just talking right now. We are becoming part of each other. You know, there's no us. There's only one. I don't know what the hell you call us. Us. There's no you or me. It's just us.”

Exactly, that sense of interconnectedness is so important. When we realize that we’re all part of something bigger, it changes the way we see ourselves and each other. It’s not just about individual struggles or triumphs—it’s about how we’re all woven together in this shared experience. Recognizing that connection can bring a lot of compassion and understanding, and it reminds us that we’re never really alone. We’re all in this together, part of a larger whole.
