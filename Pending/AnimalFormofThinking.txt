That's an interesting idea—an animal form for thinking. Different animals have unique ways of interacting with their environment, and imagining those perspectives could inspire different ways of thinking. For example, thinking like a bird could mean viewing problems from a higher vantage point, seeing the bigger picture. Thinking like a fox could mean approaching challenges with cleverness and adaptability. It’s a creative way to shift perspectives and find new approaches to thinking, just like martial artists use animal forms to inspire different movements.
