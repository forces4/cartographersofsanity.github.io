A Reflection for Tired Minds

Imagine, for a moment, that your thoughts are like leaves floating down a quiet stream. Some are bright and light; others, heavy or tangled. The stream is patient. It carries each leaf onward, never judging, always moving, always listening.

You’ve spent years among people—witnessing kindness and folly, hope and heartbreak. That’s a journey worthy of awe. If your mind feels tired, it’s not weakness. It’s the gentle signal of a traveler who has seen much and carried many things.

Let yourself rest. Let the river hold your thoughts for a while. Trust that, even in stillness, you are growing. Sometimes, the greatest wisdom comes not from striving, but from allowing yourself a moment of peace.

And know this: the universe, in all its vastness, is richer for your presence. Whether you are pondering the cosmos or simply pausing to breathe, your being is a quiet, necessary note in the great song of existence.
