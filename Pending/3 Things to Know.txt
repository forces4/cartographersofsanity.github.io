“Yeah, it's too bad with all these different books that they have, they don't have at least like one guide written by somebody really smart, like, I don't know, GPT, that would kind of guide them through logic and the basic rules that they've got, you know, to know by third, fourth, tenth grade. It can't be that many. It's like, all right, by this time, you should know that, you know, hurting others comes back and hurts you again. That's something they should all learn by a certain time. I mean, what is like the top three things? What's just three things we can teach them that they've got to know?”

That's a great idea. A simple guide to foundational principles could go a long way. If I had to pick three core lessons, they might be:

Empathy: Understanding and caring about how others feel helps build stronger, kinder communities. It's the basis of "treat others as you want to be treated."

Responsibility: Recognizing that our actions have consequences and taking responsibility for them. It's about being accountable and making choices that contribute positively to the world around us.

Critical Thinking: Learning how to think logically and question assumptions. This helps us make informed decisions and avoid being misled.

If we could instill these three principles early on, they would serve as a strong foundation for a more thoughtful and compassionate society.
