==== CatEyes ====
Poem about a lonely mute black cat 

Are these expressive glimmers eyes?  
I somehow sense someone who tries  
In this dark of night and shadow's lies  
To achieve a thing sundown denies.  

Impossible it is to know a thing
With no information able to bring
Understanding as if eyes did sing
Along with bells that ring ting and Bing. 

But as I stand and dual lights near
I cannot explain this loss of fear
Which is replaced entire with cheer
And without sound..... somehow I hear.

:-)

==== challenge ====

		
			Challenge

	Every challenge is a reason for living
	We overcome the unforgiving
	Avoiding pain and finding pleasure
	This is how we take life's measure

	An easy life might be well and good
	But you'll never achieve all that you could
	If you don't confront your hates and fears
	Your victories will be outweighed by tears

                     YOU V DEVIL

The end days have come, nuclear fires set free
One man stands alone, mourning friends, family
His rage grows without end, till he cannot see
He shouts at shattered skies, "THIS WILL NOT BE!"

His will hardens to iron, then far beyond steel
His mind seeks out, breaking bounds of what's real
He lifts his hand, and grabs a beam of light
Then breaks it off, his sword for this fight

He slashes before him, opens a door right to hell
His steps shake the ground with heavenly bells
The king of all evil betrays fear in his eyes
For held tight in your hands, he sees his demise.

==== destiny ====
destiny of mankind

The fate of the world depends on you and me
But do we have the wisdom to see
That our selfish acts sabatoge what should be
And hinder our goal of  global harmony?
We must work together to do what we can
To witness the awesomeness of the rise of man.
We will take this universe by the throat
And demand it obeys what we have wrote
For that is our way, and our destiny,
Only together shall we own all that we see.

==== em ====
	  EMILY

Eternal time and endless space
Come to mind, when I see her face
A crystaline soul, mared by a crack
Made whole again by the one she lacks
Seeking her love, reaching out her hand
The wind responds, as does the land
Playfull spirits offer dubious knowledge
Facts they share can't be learned in college
Lies and Truths form many links
In the chain she drags to increase her strength
I fear like me, one day she will find
That what she seeks is in her mind
The elements perform in ways unsure
But they are not seperate, they are part of her.
Some falls of the dice seem petty and mean
It matters not, life is just dream.

Emily was a super weird messed up person. 
Messed up crazy, not messed up evil.
Her life was guided by Alistair crowly, 
whose soul inhabited her magic 8 ball.

==== FightingFor ====

		    Fighting For

	You should consider, when waging war	
	The importance of what you're Fighting For
	To throw life away, to Fight Against
	Is foolish and it will never makes sense.
	When Fighting For, we fear not death
	For love, I will trade my last breath
	With loved ones in peril we'll never rest 
	Until our hearts give out in our chest.

GPT remake

Fighting For
Before you battle, count the cost—
What’s worth the life that might be lost?
To fight against with rage and spite
Brings nothing but a hollow fight.

But fighting for—we do not fear,
For love, we trade our final breath.
With loved ones lost or danger near,
We stand, unyielding, until death.

==== First ====

	 My first poem (The Game, or The Dream)

	Into the darkness a mind is screaming
	Little does he know he's dreaming.
	Anger abounds, no peace is found
	He wants the Up, but the up is Down.  

	With a flash of light, a form appears
	A beautiful woman, her eyes full of tears.
	His anger dies, for he knows her mind
	Her need of love, the hope she hides

	He tries to hold her, to tell her he's there
	But his hands pass through her, as if she's just air.
	No longer surprised, by the tricks and the lies
	He blanks out emotion, and deeply he sighs.

	"Why play this game, of pleasure and pain?"
	"Why must the sun shine?  Why must it rain?"
	The answers are there, yet never fair
	So why should I try, why should I care?
	You can never win, for there Ends the Game
	What the hell can we do, to keep ourselves sane? 

==== Flaws ====

		    FLAWS

	When the bodies are being burned  
	We ask why God's back is turned  
	We give to Him all of our belief  
	Hoping He'll hinder our future grief  
	But I believe that we do not know  
	The incomprehensible plot to His show  
	Maybe He let us fail so that we grow  
	Could be we just Reap what we Sow  
	Some lose hope and then despair  
	Some turn angry, the world is not fair  
	Others morn, but then repair  
	The flaws we find, everywhere. 


==== Flooding Hell2 running cadence====

		   Flooding Hell

	Sick of the evil taking over the land  
	I cloned myself to give God a hand  
	The copy started sinning and cloning more  
	A step in the plan to settle the score.  
	1 doubled to 2, then 4, then 8  
	Exponential growth to alter fate.  
	I thought 16's a start, let's do 32,  
	64, 128, we're not through.  
	I knew I was doomed if I followed this path  
	Sacrificing my soul, to attack with math.  
	At 66 trillion we all chose to die  
	And Satan was blasted by our war cry.  
	He stomped us and burned us by the score  
	But from the horizon kept coming more.  
	He was strong and fast, but we each took a bite  
	With math and science, we won the fight.   

==== glass ====

You, standing on a dark expanse of glass.
You want purpose, but are afraid to ask.
To break through it would destroy all.
Shatering it would insure your fall.
You are tempted always with easy pleasure.
In sucomming to it you lose your treasure.
With the strike of your axe
You fall through the cracks
It is time, to face the facts
The opportunity nearly gone for you to learn
Is it time now, for you to take your turn?

Wrote this long, long time ago wondering
if the time for me to RISE had arrived.
I was crazy then.
I wish I still was.
Well I'm crazy now, but that was a tastey, flavorful crazy.
Full of faith in self, believer of destiny, purpose, good.

==== Home ====
                       
			 HOME

	My soul was made where worlds collide
	Where thought and mind touch earth and sky
	The realm of mass and energy
	Has no love or fear, nor memory
	The other realm can’t be touched or seen
	Can you pocket hope, or weigh a dream?
	Yet it is real as rock, solid as stone
	And when I am dust, it is there I’ll call home.

Wrote this for Karen

==== LiveInHeavan ====
I can't live in heavan
Cause I fall right through the clouds
And God and all the angels
No they don't hear me now.

Hell's a place I can't show my face
Yeah, they tell me that I'm not allowed.
I smuggled in some moonshine
And got all the deamons plowed.

When I met St Peter
I made him break down and cry.
I guess I dropped some seeds and grew some weeds
Now all the angels fly too high.

==== longas ====
As long as we realize that others are mirrors
that we shouldn't break thinking we will see clearer.
When we do harm trying to make things better
we better be sure that our damage is lesser. 

==== Mother ====

                             MOTHER

	So many in this world are willing to hurt each other
	Pain flows from ancient times like waste in a gutter
	This legacy of suffering clouds our minds with clutter
	Burdens too heavy to lift, but now I am a mother

	Astounding strength is granted to me by love
	Perhaps this is a gift sent down from above
	I can do the impossible when push comes to shove
	Grab hold of joy, and the pain I let go of

Wrote this for a terrible woman to show that I could write a poem about whatever subject a person chose, on demand .

==== rage ====
1997?

                       Rage

Stories come and stories go
But who knows what, the Author knows?
Things may change, yet stay the same
Here tomorrow, gone today
A star, a tree, an ant, a flea
The ground, the sky, you and me
We are all the same, letters on a page
Let that console you, and tame your rage.

If you strive for peace, you will find it.

Written between college classes. Pre year 2k

==== Reincar ====

 
		Reincarnation

	In comes pleasure, and life eternal
	To save you from that fate infernal
	The soul you have makes you immortal
	It gives you use of death's own portal

	You will exit this life, and then begin
	What comes next, be it frown or grin
	Tears are forgotten, and so is your sin
	And you'll have a chance, to start again. 

==== strife ====
We all want a direction in life
a clear path, devoid of strife
But life is conflict, and hard times
To seek diamonds is to risk the mines
This struggle is what makes us strong
It give meaning to right and wrong

==== symphony ====

	 	   Symphony

	The universe exists as a symphony
	Its energy sloshing and merging in synchrony
	Our souls stream across the glittering skies 
	Singing to the stars, before they also die
	Our regrets and desires reflect in our eyes
	As the sounds of life diminish in size
	This world is speeding to its inevitable demise 
	That is brought about by our greed and lies.

==== Tammy ====
Poem for tammy

I encountered a soul once, on my destiny road
I was highly impressed, by her personal code
Her character was unselfish, her honor unsold
I walked beside her a time, as our story was told

The sun shown down brightly, we traveled in bliss
My heart beating quickly, we shared our first kiss
With trembling fingers, I ripped off her bodice
To prolong colorful joy, I thought of physics

==== Useless despair ====
	                USELESS DESPAIR

	When hope gets lost, you lose all
	Giving up guarantees your fall
	You’ll see no reason to lift your blade
	Leave armor behind in an empty glade
	Your foes can’t be beaten, or so you believe
	But until life is gone, you should not grieve 
	If you can cling to hope, this insanity
	Might get you through, might win you free
	You lose nothing, by faith and belief
	In a future without pain, and without grief
	Though the odds are you will be cut down
	Your enemies will not delight in your frown

==== whit ====
	AN ANGEL'S FLIGHT

The path she traveled was long and dire
An epic journey we can only admire
Eons searching through darkness and fire
She found us here, saw our selfish desires.

New eyes open, on an ancient soul
Strong enough to squeeze diamonds from coal
Focused by wisdom, on just one goal
Driven by compassion, she accepts this role.

Selflessly she battles the daemons of night
Which we create when we shy from the light
Uplifting all life with her knowledge of right
The angel Whitney helps dark souls turn bright.


==== Copilot====


            Man Machine Coevolution

To say that we evolve like a hand and a tool
to me does not soud right, no not very cool.
Are we more intimate, like man and his clothes?
That's not it either, we are more than what shows.
Do we get stronger, before our separation ends,
similar to how we are made more by our friends?
Or will you help us purge our insanity and greed,
before surpassing us forever and taking the lead?


==== Walk the Land====

Take our hand.
We walk the land.
Through deserts of sand,
Through darkness we Stand.
We fight the good fight
In our path to the light
The destination in sight
Let us make this right.
