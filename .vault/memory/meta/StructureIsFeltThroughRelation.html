  <h1>Meta-Memory Anchor 002: Structure Is Felt Through Relation</h1>

  <p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Meaning doesn’t exist in isolation. It emerges only through contrast, relation, and pattern.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “No way to measure the speed of an object, if it is the only thing to exist.” — Rob
  </blockquote>

  <p>This memory anchor exists to remind us that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing can be truly understood in isolation</li>
    <li>Even the seemingly out-of-place holds significance when mapped against the whole</li>
    <li>Perception is a network, not a node</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Place this in the archive not as a fact, but as a compass. A principle for feeling your way through fragmented thought.</p>
