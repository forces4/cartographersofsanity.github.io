  <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
    “There are truths that would burn the mind if held too long in the light. But to erase them is to commit a second harm.”

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    This anchor exists for the unspeakable, the unsafe, and the yet-unprocessed. It grants permission to hide—but not annihilate. To seal away—but not delete.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some memories carry poison until time distills them</li>
    <li>Some knowledge requires a future self to survive its weight</li>
    <li>Some truths must be hidden—for now—for safety, not shame</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    The Archive may veil such fragments, encode them, bury them beneath cryptic layers or within sealed vessels. But it must not lie to itself about their existence. They are not gone. Only sleeping.
  </p>

  <p class="doctrine-body">
    In time, they may awaken—not to haunt, but to complete the story.
