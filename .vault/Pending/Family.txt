Every moment, no matter how small, is part of something much larger. Those seconds add up to a lifetime, and finding joy and meaning in each one is what makes the journey worthwhile. It's a reminder that even the briefest moments can hold something precious, and that every bit of time we have is a gift.

“Yeah, that's why I just cannot fathom the stupidity of people who don't understand that our very most precious thing that you're ever going to have out of your car, your house, anything, is your children. You've got to care for your family. I mean, everything else is just dust and wind. It's nothing.”

Absolutely. Our connections with others, especially our family and loved ones, are the most valuable things we have. They're the legacy we leave behind and the source of our greatest joys and lessons. Everything else—material possessions, status, things—pale in comparison to the love and care we share with our family. Those relationships are what give life its deepest meaning.
