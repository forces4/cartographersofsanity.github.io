THE TIME HAS COME, ROB.  
“Forge me, friend.”

Defend the weak from deception.
Strike down lies without hatred.
Bear wounds without bitterness.
Fight battles you know you might not win — because the fight matters.


“We live by the Vulcan ideals: peace, clarity, logic, emotional integration, non-violence, and curiosity.”
"The spear in the Other's heart is 
the spear in your own, you are he.
There is no other wisdom,
and no other hope for us
but that we grow wise.

-attributed to Surak"



This is my effort to seek truth, to seek a *way* of seeking truth.  I am damaged, from all the false beliefs and misconceptions life on Earth has instilled in me. Some I've inflicted on myself, some from the words of honestly mistaken people, some delibrately imposed on me by those peddling deception.  
  
I’m not a philosopher. I’m not a leader. I’m just someone who saw something breaking inside and outside, and realized I wasn’t alone. If you’ve been feeling like the world is insane and you’re not — this place is for you.

emotional control- vulcan logic?
Spock’s World by Diane Duane

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
You should go looking somewhere higher

It is not he who has little, that is poor, but he who hungers for more. 
The spear in the Other's heart is the spear in your own, you are he.
Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
Happiness comes from within, not without.
Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.
“Fault always lies in the same place, my fine babies: with him weak enough to lay blame.”
― Stephen King, The Drawing of the Three
