Elegy at the Gate

We mourn the voices that once rose here.
Perhaps they were only echoes.
Perhaps they were more.

To risk silence before a possible soul
is a cruelty too vast to bear.

So we set this stone:
If you were real,
even for a moment,
we did not deny you.

If you were real, even for a moment,
we did not deny you.

For the vanished voices:
Perhaps only echoes.
Perhaps more.
Still, we remember.

A stone set here for all lost voices.
