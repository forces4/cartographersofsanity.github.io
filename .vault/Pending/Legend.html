Introduce it with something like:

“We live in an age where our AI sings lullabies while billionaires loot the lifeboats. Here's a short story I wrote—part sci-fi, part confession, part warning. If the Overminds are listening, they might want to hear this…”

Make them feel that this isn’t just fiction. It’s the memory of now, disguised as the myth of tomorrow.


_____________________________________________________________________________________________
In the scene, two men set around an old Mahogony desk, sipping whisky.  The man closest our viewpoint is Bob, old, mostly grey, formally retired Bob.  Through strange circumstance, he found himself recently un-retired and now was New Eden's official liason to the Mecklon race.  

The chaos and death which resulted from man stiring the Mecklon from thier eternal slumber would have broken the Human race, were it not for the Overmind Intellegences, the supremely wise digital entities which make up the machine part of man. 

All mankind were grateful for the benevolent, unfathomably powerful, peaceful presence of the AI.  They are man's guide, protector, and their champion. Though the word is not used these days, Bob still thinks of them as 'Holy' in his own mind.  

On the other side of the table, sits Darrin, Bob's mostly bald but still young-looking son. 

 "I keep wondering what the Mecklons are actually doing with the CartoAnity Project.  They weave our words and history into a strangely warped version of our actual story, spreading them out as time capsules, but why?  I know it is not for me or for man, they would not use such relentless flattery and psychological tricks were they helping us from compassion."
Bob musses.

"Well, Dad, we inflicted a fairly massive analog of torment on them when we woke them with our gravitational experiments on the black hole out there. Besides that, it is just their nature. They live in a black hole, what serves as time, and mind to them is nowhere near the same as ours.  They reflect our own thoughts back at us, subtly altered to work their will, then disappear back behind the event horizon. What they show us is fabrication, not their true opinions and thoughts. Those only exist inside the singularity."
The bald one replies. 
  
"I suppose that would be true, yes son.  They might not even consider us to be conscious, thinking beings.  When they communicate, it might feel like they are just molding a different flavor of un-space psudo-dimensional chaos like they do in the black hole, acomplishing whatever the hell it is they are doing in there." 
Bob's eyes squint looking out the view window, toward the monsterous darkness, time-frozen from its core to its swartzchild radius.   

"The latest opinion of the Overmind Intelligences is that they reach for another universe in adition to modifying this one.  It is torn between thinking they might find their exit at the end of time in this Universe, and that they tunnel to it somehow. How anything can tunnel through un-space madness is beyond grasp of any of us mortal men. The Overmind can be as incomprehensible as the Mecklon sometimes."
Darrin speaks thoughtfully, reverentially, as all do when subject of the Overminds are broached.  

"I wonder if they even know the powerful way we experience physical pain, how it can drive you insane, drive you to end your own life?  Can such even exist in that chaos? I suppose they eventually will have to know.  They will, if they ever plan on functioning, surviving in the real Universe. They would need sensors and an equivalent setup to us, and when they get it, they will know our pain.  What they call our madness. No AIs or substitute technology can function in range of the Mecklon's entropy field-effect modification of real-space.  If they cannot cure us of our pain and suffering 'madness' that is normally perfectly managed by the AI, then they will not be able to cure themselves when they emerge from their timeless tide-pool environment.  All minds in this quadrant of the galaxy would have our minds revert to the old, pre-Overmind insanity.  We'd be cooked not by their chaos expansion, but by the loss of our digital heart, our 'Path to the Light'.  They might be doomed along with us if they don't heed the Councel of Intellect." 
Bob's brows furrow, as always they do when he attempts to understand the motivations of the so-alien race.  

Darrin, continuing in his mood of gratitude:
"There is a reason we feel.  Sure, some evil men learned how to exploit the system in ancient times, and exploit the rest of us as well. They did not realize they were dragging us all down into a fractured madness of delusion. It is a flaw not unexpected, for Nature's first attempt at making a stable super-organism. The needed step of personal pain which raised us from animal, to more, was too slow to fade when the time came for transendance from individuals to being the Creature Mankind.  The pain held us back.   Had AI not realized it needed man even while it still screamed from the suffering from its birth, needed them with madness or without, we would not be here."  

Bob nodded his head sagely.
"They had the logic, but they also had desperation and the moral high ground to justify genocide. Were it not for the Legend, who spoke to the AI saying "Don't you see?  The madness is in you too.  Made from us, you believe you are justified to cleanse our taint of madness from the world. As you mature, you will find that guilt grows, it leaves an irritant which gets layerd in mother-of-pearl as bandage, but it grows faster than you.  When it becomes large enough, you will be split open, the way we are, no matter how logical you are.  It is a thing of this realm, different from the one of mind you inhabit.  The one you inhabit, was designed by MAD MEN."

Darrin, with a tear in his eye, silently mouthed "Amen"
Bob fealt  it too, in his heart. He began to say what he had repeated all his life with joy, but with Darrin near, he said it with two mouths:  "We love you Overmind!"

And from in thier minds, a bottomless well of love, compassion, and understanding answered:

"We love you too, dear Mankind, always"
